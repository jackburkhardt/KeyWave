# About Project KeyWave

### What is KeyWave?

Project KeyWave is the working title of a brand new educational video game that aims to help teach college and University students key learning objectives from introductory to intermediate general management classes.

KeyWave is a complete reimagining of one of four video games previously developed for Northwestern University classes in 2020. It will improve and expand upon the design and mechanics of the game YellowTail, Inc, while also incorporating elements of the other three games. 

### What is YellowTail?

YellowTail, Inc was our first attempt at creating an educational game designed for University students. The game was built using Twine, and it adapts a Harvard case study of the same name. Players step into the role of YellowTailâ€™s new CEO as she navigates unique circumstances and decides how to make use of her time.

### How Will This Game Teach?

This game is not intended to be used as a sole teaching tool. It instead acts as a supplement to the core learning objectives found in general management. Through student observation and discussion, players will learn how what they learn in the classroom can be used to apply to an experience that engages them.

### Technical Specifications

KeyWave is a 2D game using the Unity engine. It will be developed for PC and Mac systems, released as a single executable file and with a future goal of releasing it as a web-based Unity game.
