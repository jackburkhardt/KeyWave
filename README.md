## It's time to lead

Perils and Pitfalls is an educational role-playing video game for managerial students. You play as Daniel Olivera, a recent business school grad tasked with turning a struggling clothing store around. You have one day left before starting -- how will you prepare?

The game is based on the case study *The Perils and Pitfalls of Leading Change* and the book *Before Day One* by William J. White. It has a complimentary lesson plan for use in the classroom.

### Technical details

Perils is built on Unity 2021.3.45f1 LTS and supports the WebGL platform. It is designed expressly for deployment by SimCase, Inc.

Tested on Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Safari. Not supported on mobile devices.
