  - Welcome to Perils and Pitfalls! This is a choice-based game, where decisions
    can affect the narrative and the outcome of your adventure.
  - The game will present different ways of making choices, depending on the current
    context. Sometimes, the choices will be presented underneath game text, as you
    have experienced already.
  - Other times, the game will present choices in an interactive menu. In either
    case, you can use your mouse, or your keyboard, to select a choice.
