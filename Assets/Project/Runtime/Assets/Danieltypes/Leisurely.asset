  description: "Look, things are about to get busy these next few days. That means
    the most important task is to feel good before the work begins. You spent your
    day getting cleaned up, enjoying the city, and conserving your energy. When others
    would be expending themselves trying to prepare for everything, you stockpiled
    energy and momentum. Tomorrow you\u2019ll unleash this management energy and
    get the store back on track."
