  description: "Clothing&Associates sent you on mission to save a struggling store.
    But they don\u2019t know about your <i>secret</i> mission. That is, to become
    the ultimate knower of all things Vitoria. You spent your day travelling everywhere,
    exploring every corner of this new city. Some might consider it a poor use of
    time. But you know that your knowledge of the city will become invaluable for
    re-orienting the marketing of this store."
