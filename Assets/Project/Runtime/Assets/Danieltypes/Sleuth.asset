  description: You prefer to operate inconspicuously. You spent the day hitting the
    pavement and gathering untainted information. Imagine how different things would
    be if your team had immediately known it was you when you walked through the
    door! Tomorrow you can step out into the light and use this intelligence to get
    the store back on track.
