  description: "It is unknown what you did in a past life that has made you so\u2026sorry.
    This past day you told a lot of people \u201Csorry\u201D where you have done
    no wrong. Chin up! You should be proud of how far you have gotten to this point.
    It\u2019s time to stop apologizing and get your hands dirty turning this store
    around. Tomorrow is a new day with new mistakes, so move with confidence instead
    of meekness."
